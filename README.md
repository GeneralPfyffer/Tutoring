# Tutoring
Save students, lessons and more in a simple python program.

I am making this program to learn some python coding and to have something where I can save various data on students for tutoring. Functions include up to date:

-Saving student names and how much they pay
-Saving lessons for the students with a total work time

Functions that I am gonna try to add are:

-Calculating total money for a time period
-Saving address of students
